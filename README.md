Developing Data Products -- Course Project
==========================================

Course Project for Coursera.com online course: Developing Data Products

The course project shiny app is an app that allow user to retrieve basic information on all the counters in Bursa Malaysia Stock Exchange. The demo can be found here: https://yongkheng.shinyapps.io/bursamon.

The app is pretty basic due to short of time. Will probably revise it to add in indicator curves when I am more free. Feel free to give me any feedback at goh.yongkheng@gmail.com.
