## Bursamon - The Data

The app is based on the daily stock prices from Yahoo!Finance. The stock counters are identified by codes. For example the code '6033.KL' is for the stock Petronas Gas Berhad.

```{r message=FALSE}
library(quantmod)
symbol = '6033.KL'
getQuote(symbol, what=yahooQF('Name'))
```

## Bursamon - The Chart

The chart produced in the app is predefined. Clients are welcome to feedback on the type of chart that they would like to have in the Bursamon app. We will customize for you! Here is a candlestick chart.


```{r results='hide', message=FALSE, fig.height=4}
getSymbols("YHOO")
chartSeries(YHOO, type='candlestick')
```
